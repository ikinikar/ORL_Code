# ORL_Code
This is a facial recognition project on the ORL dataset that achieves around 89% efficacy. I worked on this project under the guidance of Prof. Makarand Deo of Norfolk State University in 2021. I will soon make updates to this project that use PyTorch and potentially attempts working with image distortion.
